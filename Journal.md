Today, I started researching. My goals for this eReader are for it to be reasonably compact, have an intuitive interface,
and to provide a satisfactory reading experience. There isn't exactly the <i>most</i> precedent for this sort of thing, so I'll have
to dig deep to figure this out.

Luckily, there are still some examples to take inspirations from, the most well known being The Open Book by Joey Castillo!

Included are all the neccessary files to build an Open Book. I plan on taking heavy inspiration from this project, as I've never made something
so complex.

I also did some digging on e-Ink projects in general, which are helping me better understand how everything will fit together.

I think I'm going to use a esp32 for a microcontroller, and I want this eReader to also be rechargable.

Time Spent: 2 hours
